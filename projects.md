# Class project 
All the students should at least create, post and validate one custom FHIR Resouces 

## Project 1: HMIS Register in FHIR 
1. Select one Register from (HMIS Register)[https://drive.google.com/file/d/12gxwITTB7JszzVKw-oNRcBbh658tP9nd/view], map it to FHIR resources. 
2. It will mapped to more than 1 FHIR resouces, List out all these mapped resouces. 
3. If you can profile all the mapped resouces, that is best ,  else profile relevant resource, and also please provide reason on why you choose that resources. 
4. Publish the profile in HAPI and validate it. 

## Project 2 : Home Monitoring App for Chronic Disease
You have to design a care at home app, for the Hypertension patients. which will helps in recording the Blood pressure measurement. 
1. What resouces will be required? 
2. author a structure defination of those resouces and validate it against FHIR. 
3. create resouces instances and validate it. 


## Note : 
Feel free to use any JSON editors(i prefer vsCoode with Kodjin FHIR Profiler).'
You can also use FHIR profiling tools like `(forege)[https://simplifier.net/forge]` (due to time restriction we didn't include that for this class).
I can upoad PPTs on forge in google drive(if needed). 

For posting the structureDefination and validation test also feel free to use postman or other similar tools.(i prefer python for tutorils so i used only that)
