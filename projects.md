# Class project 
All the students should at least create, post and validate one custom FHIR Resouces 

## Project 1: HMIS Register in FHIR 
1. Select one Register from (HMIS Register)[https://drive.google.com/file/d/12gxwITTB7JszzVKw-oNRcBbh658tP9nd/view], map it to FHIR resources. 
2. It will mapped to more than 1 FHIR resouces, List out all these mapped resouces. 
3. If you can profile all the mapped resouces, that is best ,  else profile relevant resource, and also please provide reason on why you choose that resources. 
4. Publish the profile in HAPI and validate it. 

## Project 2 : Home Monitoring App for Chronic Disease
You have to design a care at home app, for the Hypertension patients. which will helps in recording the Blood pressure measurement. 
1. What resouces will be required? 
2. author a structure defination of those resouces and validate it against FHIR. 
3. create resouces instances and validate it. 


## Note : 
Feel free to use any JSON editors(i prefer vsCoode).'
You can also use FHIR profiling tools like `(forege)[https://simplifier.net/forge]` (due to time restriction we didn't include that for this class).
I can upoad PPTs in google drive(if needed). 

For posting the structureDefination and validation test also feel free to use postman or other similar tools.(i prefer python for tutorils so i used only that)
